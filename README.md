- 👋 Hello, I'm Surya Rajendra Babu!

🧪 With over a decade of hands-on experience in Software Application Testing and a passion for ensuring the highest quality in software, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. I proudly hold an ISTQB certification and possess in-depth knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). 

🔍 My testing repertoire spans various types, including Functional, System, System Integration, Regression, Performance, User Acceptance, and UI Testing. I've honed my skills in test automation, harnessing tools like Selenium Webdriver and Silk Performer for Performance Testing. I'm equally comfortable with scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java.

📊 I have a solid grasp of QA methodologies and processes, and I'm well-versed in Agile/Scrum models, having played a pivotal role as the Test Lead on a high-priority project. In this role, I skillfully managed a dynamic team of 40 members, ensuring project delivery on schedule. This experience not only showcased my leadership abilities but also demonstrated my adeptness in project management.

🏆 Furthermore, I'm proud to have been recognized as a valuable contributor in a client's newsletter, a testament to my dedication and skill in the field.

🔍 I'm actively on the lookout for opportunities in the industry that can leverage my skills as a QA Engineer, Test Automation Engineer, Test Engineer, or Senior Test Engineer. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your next project!

📬 Feel free to reach out at rmj.surya@gmail.com or connect with me here on GitHub. I'm excited to collaborate and contribute to the world of software testing.

Happy testing! 🚀
